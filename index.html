<h1>Ryan Carswell</h1>
<p>I graduated from Cary Christian School this year, 2020, and I'm now attending online classes at Bob Jones University to help lighten my course load when I go to College,
  and give myself a better understanding of computers and technology.</p>
<p>I played 3 sports in High School, Football, Wrestling, and Lacrosse. 
  Wrestling was definately my favorite, and I place 3rd in the NCISAA state tournament.</p>
